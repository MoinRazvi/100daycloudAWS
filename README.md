# ☁️ 100 Days of Cloud – AWS Learning Roadmap

## 📘 Overview
This repository documents my **100 Days of Cloud (AWS)** journey, focused on building **practical, production-oriented skills** across AWS core services, networking, security, automation, and observability.

The goal is not just to complete labs, but to **understand architectural intent, best practices, and operational trade-offs** that apply to real-world cloud environments.

Each day represents a **hands-on task**, backed by validation steps and architectural insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a strong foundation in **AWS core services**
- Practice **secure-by-default** infrastructure design
- Gain confidence with **real-world DevOps scenarios**
- Develop a **public portfolio** demonstrating consistent learning
- Prepare for **cloud engineering / DevOps roles**

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy
- **Hands-on first**: Every concept is validated through labs
- **Least privilege & security by design**
- **Automation-aware** (CLI, user data, repeatable steps)
- **Verification-driven** (health checks, metrics, validation)
- **Architectural thinking**, not just clicks
